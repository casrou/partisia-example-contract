# Token contract example

This is an example token smart contract.

The contract has a constant total supply of tokens.
The total supply is initialized together with the contract.

Any token owner can then `transfer` tokens to other accounts, or `approve` other accounts to use their tokens.
If a Alice has been approved tokens from Bob, then Alice can use `transfer_from` to use Bob's tokens.

The contract uses the standard MPC-20 format you can find [the specification here](https://partisiablockchain.gitlab.io/documentation/smart-contracts/integration/mpc-20-token-contract.html)

The contract is inspired by the ERC20 token contract:
